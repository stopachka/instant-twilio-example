# instant-twilio-auth-example

This started shows you how you could use Twilio to implement "Log in with your phone number" on Instant.

Check out: [src/api](/src/app/api/magic/) for the backend endpoints you need to implement. Check out [src/app/](/src/app/page.tsx) for the frontend.

To set things up, copy over `.env.example` to `.env`, and fill in the details with your own variables.

To try it out:

```bash
bun
bun --bun run dev
```
